Aim:

To write a C++ program that accepts an integer input from the user and determines whether the number is even or odd.

Theory:

 An even number is an integer that is exactly divisible by 2 (remainder 0).

  An odd number is an integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

 The modulus operator % calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another.

 In this program, num % 2 checks if the remainder is zero.

 If the remainder is zero, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.

 if-else statements are used for decision making in C++.

 cin is used to take input from the user.

 cout displays output on the screen.

Conclusion:

The program correctly reads an integer input from the user and determines whether it is even or odd by using the modulus operator and conditional statements. This demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and decision-making constructs in C++.
